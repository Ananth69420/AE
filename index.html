        disha, idk how to write shit properly but this is straight from me.<br>
        weâ€™ve been through a lot. from random calls to fighting to fixing shit â€” i still want it all with you.<br>
        youâ€™re home to me. this is just a small reminder of the stuff i love about you. (thereâ€™s more but iâ€™m shy lol)
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>your smile, always.</li>
        <li>how you care, even when youâ€™re mad at me.</li>
        <li>your voice, it feels like home.</li>
        <li>when you laugh at my dumb jokes.</li>
        <li>late night calls that turn into therapy.</li>
        <li>when you tell me things no one else knows.</li>
        <li>just you, honestly.</li>
